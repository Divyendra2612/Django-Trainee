Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller.

Proof with Code
To confirm this, we will:

Print the thread ID in both the caller function and the signal handler.

Compare if they are the same.
import threading
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal handler running in thread: {threading.get_ident()}")

# Simulating a model save operation
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"Main thread ID: {threading.get_ident()}")
    user = User(username="testuser")
    user.save()
